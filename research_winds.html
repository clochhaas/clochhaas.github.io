										<h2>Galactic Winds</h2>
										<p>and other projects in my PhD thesis</p>
									</header>

                                    <p>My PhD dissertation work focused on using a combination of analytic models, simulations, and observations to describe the interaction between
                                        galactic winds and the CGM. With Professor <a href="http://astronomy.osu.edu/people/thompson.1847">Todd Thompson</a>, I developed a model of
                                        a supernovae-driven galactic wind bubble to explain the COS-Halos results (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...792....8W">Werk
                                        et al. 2014</a>), where an unusually large mass of cold (T = 10<sup>4</sup> K) gas was observed in absorption in background quasar spectra
                                        at distances of up to 160 kpc from the center of the galaxies in the sample. Both star-forming and passive galaxies have this cold gas,
                                        and it cannot be supported in hydrostatic equilibrium. We published a paper describing our analytic model,
                                        <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180400741L">"Fast Winds Drive Slow Shells: A Model for the Circumgalactic Medium as Galactic
                                        Wind-Driven Bubbles"</a>.</p>
                                    
                                    <img src="images/bubble_cartoon.png" alt="A cartoon of the wind bubble model" width="400"><img src="images/vel_vs_b.png" alt="Velocity of absorption in the wind bubble model compared to observations" width="400">
                                    
                                    <p>The above left diagram shows the many regions of the wind bubble model, and the above right plot shows the velocity of the cool edge of the
                                        bubble, as a function of impact parameter of a sight line, compared to the velocities of observed absorption lines in the COS-Halos sample.
                                        A range of bubbles with various ages and wind-driving parameters accurately predicts the range of observed velocities.</p>

									<p>My wind bubble model has now been applied to explain a number of different observational scenarios. Of particular note is the Makani wind
										bubble, which spans 100 kpc and emits at [O II]. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Natur.574..643R/abstract">Rupke et al. (2019)</a>
										showed that the age and extent of the Makani wind can be described by our wind bubble model. More recently, I developed a new set of simulations
										to evolve my wind bubble model in a more realistic circumgalactic medium, and found that such a model could describe the new phenomenon
										of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). These objects are nearly-circular shells of radio synchrotron emission, often centered on a galaxy. If they are 
										related to the galaxies sometimes found at their centers, then they have diameters of hundreds of kpc. In 
										<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231015162C/abstract">"Ionized Gas Extended Over 40 kpc in an Odd Radio Circle Host Galaxy"</a>,
										we showed that my wind bubble model, as evidenced by new simulations, could describe both the ORC and the observed extended [O II] emission in 
										one particular object. The image below shows temperature and radial velocity slices of the simulated wind bubble at three times during its evolution.</p>

                                    <p>On the observational side, I worked with Professor <a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/mathur.17">Smita Mathur</a> to analyze a very
                                        high signal-to-noise Hubble Space Telescope UV spectrum toward the quasar J1009+0713, which has two galaxies along the line of sight to the
                                        quasar at lower redshift. We analyzed the circumgalactic medium gas seen in absorption in the quasar's spectrum to characterize the CGM of
                                        both galaxies to higher precision than ever before. The resulting paper is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180909122L">"A High
                                        Signal-to-Noise HST Spectrum Toward J1009+0713: Precise Absorption Measurements in the CGM of Two Galaxies"</a>. We found that the CGM of
                                        these galaxies contain many kinematically different phases of gas, pointing to the idea that the CGM is not only multiphase but also dominated
                                        by multiple types of physics and ionization processes. We also found that the high-ionization state metal lines that trace warm (T =
                                        10<sup>5.5</sup> K) gas could be produced by a radiatively-cooling flow traveling at v = 30-80 km/s, very similar to my wind bubble model.</p>
                                    
									<h3>Radiative cooling in starburst winds</h3>

                                    <p>In "Second Generation Stars in Globular Clusters from Rapid Radiative Cooling of Pre-Supernova Massive Star Winds"
                                        (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470..977L">ADS link</a>), we developed a model to produce multiple populations of stars within
                                        a star cluster. Most globular clusters that have been recently closely examined show evidence that they are not simple stellar populations and
                                        that they contain two or more populations with different chemical signatures. The model proposes that stellar winds from a first stellar
                                        generation can radiatively cool and remain bound to the potential of the globular cluster to form a second generation. We derived the conditions
                                        on globular cluster properties for this stellar wind cooling to occur, and determined what conditions are necessary for a second stellar generation
                                        to form at the masses and elemental abundances that match observational data. Here's a short video summarizing parts of this paper:
                                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rne8xUlWTY">Second Generation Stars in Globular Clusters</a></p>

									<p>In "The Characteristic Momentum of Radiatively Cooling Energy-Driven Galactic Winds" (which can be found
										<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.3412L/abstract">here</a>), we derived a theoretical upper limit on the
										mass and momentum outflow rate of hot galactic winds driven by supernovae in a compact starburst. The maximum comes about because
										if thermalized outflows are too mass-loaded at their source within the ISM, then they will lose the thermal energy to efficient
										radiative cooling rather than driving outflows. We compared this maximum momentum to observed outflow momenta from starburst
										galaxies and found that the maximum captures the upper envelope of the data very well. The maximum holds not just for hot winds
										but also for cool outflows, in any model where the dynamics of the outflow are driven by the dynamics of the hot phase, such as
										scenarios where cool clouds are accelerated or precipitated from the hot winds. We also derived a minimum on the outflow momentum
										under the requirement that the hot winds undergo bulk radiative cooling. The maximum and minimum momenta are very close to each other,
										producing a characteristic outflow momentum for thermally-driven winds that radiatively cool on large scales. The minimum assumes
										no mass-loading outside of the starburst, so it doesn’t apply to scenarios where cold clouds in the flow originate outside the
										starburst and are accelerated by the hot wind. By comparing to data, we found the minimum didn’t match the observations very well,
										implying the observed photoionized outflows are likely not directly cooling hot winds, but rather clouds entrained in or accelerated
										by the wind.</p>

									<h3>Lyman-&alpha; Forest in Simulations</h3>

                                    <p>My first project as a graduate student was with Professor <a href="http://astronomy.osu.edu/people/weinberg.21">David Weinberg</a>, "Modeling
                                        Lyman-&alpha; Forest Cross-Correlations with LyMAS" (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.461.4353L">ADS link</a>), in which we used a
                                        scheme called LyMAS for predicting the Lyman-&alpha; forest absorption in a large dark matter-only simulation to predict the cross-correlations
                                        between the forest and dark matter halos. We developed a simple functional form to describe how the correlation depends on dark matter halo mass,
                                        and used this form to infer the mass of halos hosting quasars and damped Ly-&alpha; absorbers (DLAs) by fitting the cross-correlations measured from
                                        BOSS in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012JCAP...11..059F">Font-Ribera et al. 2012</a> and
                                        <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JCAP...05..018F">Font-Ribera et al. 2013</a>. We also performed several tests of the LyMAS scheme and concluded
                                        that it works essentially perfectly in reproducing the cross-correlations from a hydrodynamic simulation in a more computationally efficient way. We
                                        compared our cross-correlations to those predicted by the linear theory of structure formation, and found that linear theory matches the full non-linear
                                        correlation predicted by LyMAS down to scales of ~15 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc. A short video summarizing parts of this paper can be found on
                                        <a href="https://youtu.be/9ghGNtF16JA">YouTube</a>.</p>
